Part 1 and Part 2 implemented and works well.
Additionally, added swipe handling - swipe right increases sides and swipe left decreases.

Note: Not sure if it does matter but Part 2 (with NSUserDefaults initialized in a bad
place - during lazy instantiation of model inside view controller) was done as
of commit 3177a9cbd4b4e976609b4aeb3f2186823da97f65 (https://github.com/kamilsmuga/COMP41550-Smuga-Kamil-12258018/commit/3177a9cbd4b4e976609b4aeb3f2186823da97f65)
